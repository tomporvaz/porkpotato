    <h1>Yurts - Mongolian Cloud Houses</h1>
    
    <p>
        Once upon a time, I built a yurt.  It was a great project in
        which I excercised my research skills, forced my self to learn 
        woodworking, and lived outside as much as I could.  I pitched
        a nomadic round tent for at least two winters, and in the pine 
        barrens while attending Stockton University.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The yurt was cozy and warm. With a woodburning stove inside,
        temperatures easily became to hot even with freezing weather
        outside.  The rain beat a song on the canvas roof, and the 
        16 feet in diameter provided just enough space for one or two.
    </p>
    <p>
        The yurt moved on to greener pastures then its storage 
        location in my parents garage. The yurt moved up to New Hampshire
        where it served as freinds forrest home.  I am proud to know that
        it lived on in northern winter conditions.  
    </p>
    <p>
        One day I will build a another yurt with more sophisticated 
        woodworking techniques, and vinylized canvas on the roof. 
        I feel like the yurt needs to live up to 
        its nomadic heritage with a design and a use case that takes
        advantage of its inherent mobility.  Currently, I dream of 
        a yurt as a home away from home, close to the ground, 
        the sky and the wild!
