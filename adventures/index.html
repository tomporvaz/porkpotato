    <h1>HIKING ADVENTURES</h1>
    
    <h3>11/30/2018 Auburn Overlook to Old Stage Coach Road Trail (5mi)</h3>
    <p>
        Arriving early with plenty of time ahead of me, I decided to park at
        the bottom of the hill.  I really like to do things the hard way!  The road
        was a nice beginning to this trek. It was a long 1.2 miles switch back through
        the woods up the hill with a nice flat gravel surface.  I met a game warden
        on my way to the top who informed me that it was open season for rifles. 
        I was prepared with my orange shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
        I met many hunters along the road and a I saw a couple on the trail too.  This
        was nothing that concearned me, and I hardly heard any more gun shots then I am 
        used to.  
    </p>
    <p>
        At the top of the road was a nice parking lot and Aubun Overlook.  Note: This is
        a nice short hike or drive for a fairly rewarding overlook.  It has a large rock 
        slide that affords a nice view looking north.  I enjoyed a quiet meditation here 
        in July, and again on this hike.  
    </p>
    <p>
        During my meditation, it began to rain, but a quick look at my weather app confirmed
        that it was nothing to fear.  I pushed on for relatively flat grade for most of my
        journey with many stretches full of rocks.  The top of a mountain is a different place
        once all the leaves have fallen.  Lots of sky showed through the forest without the
        leaves to block it.  I could really see just how thin the top of the mountain is. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The forrest had a nice variety with a lot of disiduous growth some pine and areas 
        of thick rhodedendron's.  The last leg of the journey was the hardest.  First, I 
        passed a spring which I thought indicated only 1 mile remaining.  This final mile, 
        however, included a steep desent, many rocks, and a lot of streams.  The changes
        of scenery was rewarding, but the persistent light rain had begun to soak through 
        making me a little colder then I should be in 34 degree weather.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I finished the steep desent, ate my lunch qucikly under a tree and hurried back to 
        the parking lot for my drive home.

    <h3> 
        7/28/2017 Hawk Mountain Road to The Pinnicale (10 mi)
    </h3>
    <p>
        The trail from Hawk Mountain Road was very welcoming with a sea of thick 
        green ferns as far as the eye could see.  The forest is abundant with growth
        in July.  I thought I found chantrelles and the rasberries had a few scraps
        left.  The ascent was gradual, and the terrain was much less rocky than 
        other sections I have hiked in this area.  Much of the trail follows dirt
        roads.  This was an easy hike that allowed me to cover a whole 10 miles 
        without too much complaining.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Hiking up a gradual slope I could hear a babbling brook.  As if the sound 
        wasn't enough, a small valley opened up to display a goregous stream several
        yards below me.  Yonder up the hill I lunched at the Pinnicale.  The 
        Pinnicale has been claimed to be the nicest overlook on the AT in PA, but
        I think they all look the same.  Nevertheless, it was a nice spot to stop.  
        Vultures soared beside me as I ate and looked out over the farms.  After 
        this, I walked back to my car.
    </p>
    <h3> 5/22/2017 Jacksonville Snyders Road to Hawk Mountain Road (19 mi) </h3>
    <p>
        Long overdue for some wilderness adventure time, I finnally got out to the woods for a backpacking trip.  I saved up comp time from final
        exams and graduation to go on this adventure.  Leaving home a little before 7:00 AM, I hit traffic on I-76.  I left my car at a parking 
        lot on a dirt road intersecting the AT on top of the mountain.  
    </p>
    <p>
        THe hike began quickly on a rocky dirt road.  The terrain was relatively flat for a long while and eventually encountered some ups and 
        downs.  This section of trail is loaded with water (3) and vistas (3).  Of course I didn't see much at the vistas during this soggy hike.  
        Visibility was low a top the mountain, but I did make good time getting to Dan's Pulpit.  Starting aroung 9:45 am and arriving at Dan's 
        Pulpit around 1:15 pm, I figured I kept close to a 30 minute mile even with my pack.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I saw lots of thru hikers, and got rained out of my lunch.  A long desent from Dan's Pulpit revealed many camping sites.  THe top of the
        mountain had a few sites, but most of the terrain was too rocky.  Once at Hawk Mountain Road, I had to hike left down the road to a 
        shelter for water.  
    </p>
    <p>
        The shelter was very nice. with 4 walls, a door, and a privy.  This looke to be a part of someones private property.  It even had running
        water and electricity.  
    </p>
    <p>
        So after filling up on water I headed back up the mountain.  Quite fatigued, I stopped at the first campsite I saw.  I rested up for a
        bit, then gained enough energy to push onward.  I hiked an additional 1.75 miles up the hill.  This allowed me to have a speedy return 
        in the morning so I could pick up my kids from daycare on time.  My total for the day was 11.25 miles which I think is about my limit 
        with a pack.

    <h3>
        3/27/2017 Lehigh Furnace Gap to Bake Oven Knob Road 
    </h3>
    
    
    <h3>
        2/27/2017 Palmerton Lehigh Valley to Lehigh Furnace Gap</h3>
        
        <p>
            Mountain climbing was long overdue, and this trip was great hike to get back in the groove.  Starting in Palmerton, I hiked south to 
            lehigh furnace gap.  The assent out of the lehigh valley was steep but manageable.  The woods were thick.  Once up the hill I came to 
            a spring, a shelter, and the first blue side trail.  Not much reason to go on from there.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The trail is nice with some rocks but more dirt then other sections of the AT in Pennsylvannia.  The trail is pretty flat and mostly 
            wooded.  At some point the trees become sparse, and views begin to appear.  In the winter, I could see right through the leafless trees 
            down on the farmlands below.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I ate my lunch on a nice out crop of rocks overlooking the fields.  Not too windy or cold, so I got to hang.  A little further down the
            trail and I turned around at the next dirt road.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The adventure back was a little more exciting and more challenging.  I took both side blue trails on the return.  The first was all rocks
            (more like boulders).  The walk became much more technical and offered plenty of great views.  The challenge was welcomed, and the feeling
            of barreness was worth it.  The next blue trail offered the barreness and views sans challenging rock slide.  The view was especially 
            interesting overlooking towns, highways, and the Lehigh River.  I saw a train that looked like a toy from that height and all the nooks
            of the river.  The desent was long.  I didn't see my first person until the end.  THe challenge was worth the solitude and peace.  This 
            soreness is one I am proud of.
        </p>
        
        <h3>12/28/2016 Wind Gap to Fox Gap Parking Area Rt 191 (Northbound)</h3>
        <p> 
            I set out early in the morning for what was bound to be a long day.  The trail was 8.5 miles long in one direction, so I knew
            I would need at least 9 hours to complete this stretch twice, up and back.  The trail starts off rather steep for only the first
            50 ft or so.  I continued to climb over the next mile until I reached the top of the hill.  The mountain seemed wide, and rocky.
            I have never missed a turn on a trail so much as this one on account of my focus was constanly on my footing.  Rarley able to 
            focus on the trail blazes, I followed a supposed trail several feet before I realized I was lost.   I found my way back!  I also 
            startled several groups of dear in the same manner.  Unaware of my sorroundings, I suddenly heard dear leaping in the opposite 
            direction of me.  I got a good look!
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of the mountain I noticed another mountain to the north of my position.  This is the little offset, and apparently the mountian
            spits in to two pieces.  The trail continues though different types of vegetation.  Some areas with a lot of undergrowth, other areas
            almost barren, and occasionally there unmelted pockets of snow.  I crossed several small rock slides, and eventually made it up to 
            Wolf Rocks!
        </p>
        <p>
            Wolf Rocks was spectacular!  The rock formatoins were interesting, sorrounded by laurels, and providing a splendid view over the trees.
            There aren't many views along this stretch of trail, but the sights from Wolf Rock make up for the lack.  Wolf rock stretches for a couple
            hundred feet, and it is nicely integrated with the landscape.  I would have spent more time on this cliff had the wind and temperature not
            been so fierce.  I did spend some time in aww, gathering pictures.  Close to the nothern edge of this section, I think this spot would
            be great for a day hike.  As finished the the trail,  I met many folks who agreed and had been hiking the short walk Wolf Rock from 191.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I ate a quick lunch at the end of the trail and began my return trek. Leaving aroung 1230pm, I thought I had ample time to make it back to 
            my car by dusk.  Indeed, I was right, however, I did not have ample energy.  The trail was long and I was tired.  I knew that continuos movement
            was the only thing that would get me back.  My feet were very sore, and my ankles were screaming.  I broke in my new pair of Asolos on this 
            trip, and although my feet complained, I think these shoes were more to thank than to blame.  I laced my boots up good a tight to protect my 
            ankles, and although they were sore, they were not injured.  I think hike 17 miles in a day is just to much!
        </p>
        
        <h3> 12/16/2016  Wind Gap Rt 33 to Leroy Smith Shelter Powerlines (Southbound)</h3>
        <p>
            This hike was long overdue and squeezed into the second half of my day.  Arriving to the parking lot around around 1:30pm,
            I knew that I only had 4 hours of hiking before the sun went down.  This 4 mile hike should have easily fit into this 4
            hour window, but darkness was close on my heals.  In an unussually cold week in December (High of 23F), I set out to Wind
            Gap desperate to get some nature time.  THe parking lot for this trip is on the north bound side of the road and the south
            bound trail is several hundred feet up the road and under the overpass.  The trail starts next to Rt 33, a fairly busy
            divided highway.  The trail climbs steeply up the slope of the Wind Gap, but you hardly feel the incline on the many 
            swithchbacks.  You quickly rewarded with a lookpout to the north.  For no apparent reason, the trail makes a sharp left 
            down the south side of the mountain a little to walk a trail across the slope.  A little up and down never hurt anyone.
            After this final climb, you are greeted by another overlook, Hahns Lookout, showing the towns to the south and the 
            farmlands all around.  From here the trail stays on the top of the mountain, but not without some subtle elevation changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of the mountain, I encountered much more snow from earlier in the week.  The snow was a treat covering some of the
            rocks on the trail, highlighting some tracks of rodents and beast alike, and providing a lovely crunch as meandered through
            the forrest.  The tracks showed that very few people had walked this trail recently (I saw 3 people).  I saw many human
            tracks, as well as a dog, some small rodents, bunnies, and deer.  The snow is a fabulous place to practice some tracking. 
            The snow was also quite beautiful, only covering the smaller rocks in some places and glistening in the sun where it had a
            chance to freeze and refreeze.  
        </p>
        <p> 
            The pipeline is the first landmark you come to after Hahn's Lookout.  It is somewhere in the second mile.  It privides
            another outlook and plenty of space to have a picnic.  Back in the woods the terrain remains relatively flat with many
            rocks to avoid.  On this type of ground I look at my footing more often then I look up to enjoy the view.  The top of the 
            mountain is heavily wooded and mostly deciduous.  I did see some large birch trees? and a confiferous tree occasionally.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey from the pipeline to my final destination, the powerlines, was hasty.  Having reached the pipline around 2:50
            PM, I knew needed to hurry.  Three O'Clock my half way time, and I should have turned around.  I didn't!  This rebel hiked
            full throttle anxiously waiting for the powerlines to pop out of the above the tree line.  I might have even done a brief
            jag in anticipation.  With over 1.5 miles between the pipeline and powerlines, expecting to do it in less than a half hour
            was wishful. I made it to the powerlines by 3:30 PM, my next deadline to turnaround.  
        </P>
        <p>
            I was unsure of how long it would take me to return, and when exactly the light would disappear.  I knew the sun set at
            4:30 PM, but thankfully, twilight lasted until 5:00 PM!   Having made it to Hahns' Lookout by 5:00 PM, I only had the 
            steep switchback to accomplish in the dark.  I managed and never used my flashlight.  This last part of the trail was steep
            but the ground had few rocks to be cautious of.  During twighlight and the final dark moments, the cities sparkled below 
            with streetlights and many other luminesints.  Looking from Hahn's Lookout, I enjoyed the lights of civilization, and the 
            story they told of small sprawl of a rural town.

        <p>
            On this trip I ate wild rasberries, got caught on a bare mountain top in a lightining storm, and hitched ride to escape torrential
            rains.

        <h3> ??/??/???? Deleware Water Gap to Fox Gap (14 mi)</h3>
        <p>
            At some point in the past I hiked the Deleware Water Gap to Fox, if not more.  I have hiked this section of trail at least
            once with the Boy Scouts, and also once with Leah.  I recall the time I hiked with Leah being one of the most beautiful 
            experiences.  The rhodedendron's were in bloom, and were elegantly stunning hanging over a babbling stream.  The assent was
            fierce, but offered some fabulous views of the delaware river and the resulting gap/valley.  The cliffs are shear.  I can't 
            wait to hike the jersey side to learn more about this unique homestate region.
